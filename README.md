# SwadLang-Interpreter
We developed SwedLang, an OCaml-based interpreter with syntax resembling Swedish, enhancing readability for Swedish speakers. Complementing this, we created a GPT-based model that translates natural language prompts into SwedLang code, automating code generation while adhering to its unique syntax.
